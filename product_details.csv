The RangeMaster Shoulder Pulley is ideal for restoring range-of-motion in the home or clinical setting.The BlueRanger attaches to the door via the over-door metal bracket for the BLRA-MB or by closing the Thera-Loop Woven Anchor in the door jamb for the BLRA. A patient then grips the molded rubber handles on either end of the cord and provides lift by downward force on the cord from the uninjured arm. Breast cancer survivors, patients recovering from shoulder surgery or rehabilitating frozen shoulder, torn rotator cuff or arthritis can restore range-of-motion in a safe and effective home treatment.

Archxerciser comes in retail clamshell package with instruction card. Now available in ORIGINAL and PINK!Shin splints? Knee pain? It could be weak feet  (A portion of an article published in The Bulletin on May 21, 2015 by Tara Bannow)Weak feet or ankles that lack stability can cause a number of issues up north, although people tend to overlook these areas. But because feet form the base for the body’s forward motion, they’re crucial in determining which muscles will be emphasized as the body moves. If they’re weak, a person’s balance can be completely off — a big problem for older individuals.Weak feet and instability can also contribute to ailments such as bunions; Morton’s neuroma, a painful nerve condition in the ball of the foot; Achilles tendonitis, swelling and pain in the tendon that connects the leg to the heel; hip bursitis, inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs in the hip joint; and plantar fasciitis, swelling and pain in the tendon that runs along the bottom of the foot.“You know the adage, ‘When the foot hits the ground, everything changes?’ It’s so literally true,” Ford said. “It’s oftentimes the key to treating the knee, treating the hip, treating the back, because if you can change things below, where everything starts, you can really change what’s going on above.” ",archxerciser-foot-exerciser-c8e.jpg

SKU:  PMTSB100 ,Pain Management Technologies String Back LSO Back Brace One-Size- Fits All ,"The String Back LSO utilizes a fixed wheel and string system to cinch the user into a supine position and immobilize the back region. The String Back system provides circumferential compression, and is essential in stabilizing the spine, and promoting the healing process following post-operative back surgery.Both anterior and posterior panels provide lumbar sacral support and rigidity, necessary to take the pressure off and create decompression for the spine.The String Back utilizes a comfortable soft corset brace, coupled with the String Back system, to clamp the rigid supports into place. The String Back system provides easy application through a smooth gliding tension pull system, making it easy even for weaker patients.The String Back is operated by first properly sizing the brace to the patient based on the sizing chart (note the waist measurement is around the navel). While in a standing position, the String Back can be wrapped around the waist area, with the posterior panel centered in the back area, and resting on the top of the buttocks. Velcro close the front ends with the anterior thermoplastic panel centered in the front. Make sure the wrap is tightly Velcro closed, and then lastly, pull tight the draw string cord until the desired level of support is achieved. Secure the drawstring by Velcro clasping it where you see fit on the wrap. The String Back should feel almost custom-sized and snugly fitted to the patient as the posterior panel cinches into position. The lower back region should feel slightly lifted, so as to reduce the pressure on the lower lumbar region.One size fits all,The LSO Spinal Bracing system - Indicated for use for chronic back pain, degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, stenosis, and more.Provides an anatomically correct fit, as well as, seamlessly adjustable lumbar compression.Sizing Chart (in Inches): (Measure circumference around navel) One size fits all.

SKU:  DVMLP-5208 ,Devon Medical CircuFlow Model 5208 Lymphedema Compression Therapy Pump ,"The CircuFlow 5208 is a powerful pneumatic compression therapy pump that may help patients relieve the symptoms of chronic venous and lymphatic disorders in the comfort of their own home. Patients can control the pressure, mode and cycle time allowing for the ultimate experience in customized compression therapy. Turn the device on and air begins to quickly inflate the attached garments, compressing the affected limbs and working to move the blocked lymphatic fluid in the right direction. Initial treatment with the CircuFlow 5208 is usually for one hour twice a day depending on individual advice from your doctor but it can be used for up to four hours a day in intervals of 30 minutes to two hours. The 5208 offers you the convenience that you need to customize your treatment and can begin to improve your symptoms immediately.Product FAQ'S:What size garments do I need?The most important measurement is the inseam length. Find the range that your measurement falls into and that is what size you should get. For instance, if the inseam measurement is 34 inches, you should pick a large. Then you should measure the circumference around your ankle, knee, and thigh to see if you fit the standard size, wide, or extra wide size. If your measurement is not in a range, for example 27 inches, pick the size larger than that measurement, so the correct choice would be a medium sleeve since it can accommodate up to 29 inches. Please reference the Garment Measurement Chart attached when deciding what sleeve is necessary.How long will it take my garment to inflate?Although each pump was designed to inflate every garment within three minutes, depending on what size garment is being used, filling times will vary.What if I have to end my session sooner than expected?All of the CircuFlow pumps are designed with a built in deflation cycle. To end your session, press STOP at any time and the pump will deflate the sleeve for easy removal. To further deflate the sleeve, press the STOP button again to initiate another deflation cycle. This method may be used until the garment can be taken off easily. After pressing the STOP button, the pump will not resume from its therapy from where it left ofWhat is the default setting for the CircuFlow 5150 and the 5200 device?The factory default setting for the CircuFlow 5150 is 40 mmHg of pressure in the first chamber, with a 60 minute treatment time and 7% gradient. The user has the option to change the pressure and treatment time settings.The default setting for the CircuFlow 5200 is 45 mmHg of pressure in the first chamber, 30 minute treatment time, 7% gradient, and 30 second cycle time. The user has the option to change the pressure, gradient, cycle time, treatment time settings, and the ability to skip a chamber if necessary.How do I adjust pressure and time settings on the CircuFlow 5150 sequential compression device?Although the default pressure and time is set from the factory, some adjusting may be needed based on prescriptions obtained from your physician. To adjust the CircuFlow 5150 for personal use, press and hold the MODE button for at least 10 seconds. This will show you the customizing options. Use the ARROWS to adjust for the desired time and pressure. To exit the customizing screen, press the MODE button twice to return to the default screen. Never change your settings without first discussing with your prescribing physician.Why can’t I adjust the time and pressure on the CircuFlow 5200 sequential compression device?The CircuFlow 5200 Lymphedema pump has a built in Lock Function that the physician and/or DME distributor can initiate so that the controls cannot be tampered with. To confirm the pump has been locked, press the knob down. If you are prompted for a password, then the machine is locked. If the machine is not locked and you still cannot change the mode, pressure, or time settings. Contact your pump distributor for more information.

SKU:  CRTCRYOCUP ,Cryo Therapy Plastic Cup ,"It's the CRYOCUPTM State of the Art ..... Ice Massage tool for the treatment of strains, sprains, muscle spasms, pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis and other musculo-skeletal conditions. Cryo Therapy, Inc. has a more effective solution - one that combines the cooling response of an ice pack with the effectiveness of ice message. The CRYOCUPTM - a patented simple-to-use ice applicator - reduces the time it takes for soothing cold to penetrate into muscles and begin relieving the aches and pains of muscle strains, sprains and tendinitis.Cryostretch Cryostretch is the application of cold to facilitate stretching after muscle or joint injury. Exaggerated (""overactive"") responses to active or passive range of motion can be overcome by cold-induced relief or local pain. Most Protocols suggest ice masssage before or simultaneous with active and passive range-of-motion exercises. Ice massage, for example, has been combined with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) techniques for muscle stretching to improve flexibility. Ice massage for 10 to 15 minutes is followed by passive range of motion to point at which futher motion cannot proceed because of pain or contracture. An isometric contraction is then maintained for 5 seconds, followed by a pause, and then passive range of motion to pain threshold or resisted motion. This cycle of ice application, contraction, relaxation, and stretching is repeated. Excellent results in range of motion are often achieved after several minutes of stretching, depending on individual response to passive range of motion.Cryokinetics -Cryokinetics is the use of cold therapy in stretching programs to improve voluntary effort by eliminating pain inhibition. For example, ice message to the elbow or patellar tendon prior to exercise may allow more effective strengthening of the respective forearm or quadriceps muscles. However, thers is a risk of increased injury if pain is masked by the anesthetic effect of the cold treatment. It is recommended that a passive or active range-of-motion program progress slowly to remain well within pain tolerance limits. Progress should be evaluated daily to increase or decrease intensity of effort based on the clinical response. The goal of cryokinetics is normal pain-free range of motion as well as improved strength.Plantar Fasciitis -Plantar Fasciitis is an inflammation of the strong fibrous bands that run along the bottom of your foot. It helps maintain the arch and holds the foot rigid as you walk. Along with the muscles and bones this connective tissue, the plantar fascia, forms the arch of the foot. You will usually feel plantar fasciitis pain in your arch and heel. Cryocup ice message for 10 - 15 minutes followed by stretching, to within limits of pain, is very effective. One stretching method is to use your toes to pull a towel, piece of paper or marble off the floor. Remember, the goal of rehabilitation is to do all you can to decrease the discomfort and improve flexibility and strength of your foot before returning to your previous level of activity.

SKU:  INCMIntensity ,Incontrol Medical Pour Moi Intensity Variable Electric Intimate Health and Stimulation Vibrating Massager ,"Buy Now Pay Later - make monthly payments over 3, 6, 12 months w/ Affirm financing options - Select Affirm at checkout.This trans vaginal device gets to the muscles in the most direct manner. Intensity inflates inside the vagina to place muscle stimulation contacts directly onto the pelvic floor muscles walls. This inflation feature provides active resistance to build real muscle and build it quickly. The muscle stimulation contacts make even weak muscles contract so every woman can benefit. Dr. Kegel had a great idea, (our products) make it work.According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, 43% of women experience sexual dysfunction at some point in their life. Sexual dysfunction includes low sexual desire, vaginal dryness, orgasmic dysfunction, difficulty maintaining arousal, and painful intercourse.Intensity is a variable electric intimate health device, vibrating massager, and automatic kegel exerciser. Intensity came about during clinical trials when a number of women experienced orgasms during the use of one of our other incontinence products. It was deemed that a device which could strengthen the pelvic floor by doing kegels properly while creating a powerful orgasm at the same time would benefit a lot of women, and the Intensity was born.Intensity was designed using science and Physiology to tighten the pelvic floor muscles, tightening and toning the vaginal vault. Kegel exercises are just not very effective for several reasons. The pelvic floor muscles are difficult to isolate and most peole end up contracting their abdominal or gluteal muscles. The National Institutes of Health estimates that more than half the people who attempt to do Kegel exercises do them wrong. Utilizing active resistance and gentle muscle stimulation, Intensity exercises your pelvic floor muscles, even atrophied muscles, correctly and effectively.That exercising of the pelvic floor is similar to the contractions a woman experiences during orgasm. Additionally, vibration was added to futher stimulate the external clitoris AND the internal clitoris. Yes, you have an internal clitoris that is approximately 5 inches long and runs down either side of the vaginal vault. Stimulating the external clitoris, the internal clitoris and creating internal muscle contractions results in a powerful orgasm even in women who have never experienced one before!

Preset or customized programs allow the provider to customize treatments while biofeedback and visuals create a patient-focused experience that encourages engagement and achievement of goals.VMS Treatment: Customize treatment protocol by adjusting the parameters of choice, such as Phase Duration, Frequency, and Work and Rest Time. VMS Treatment offers even more flexibility by allowing you to sequence the stimulation in the various channels to closely match the natural swallowing sequence.sEMG Treatment: Electrical signals in the muscle are measured and displayed on a screen and are amplified into sounds that the patient can hear. This feedback increases patient effort and participation, and provides the data and documentation required to measure patient outcomes and quantify progress.sEMG + Triggered Stim: The patient initiates the swallowing exercise with the assistance of sEMG biofeedback. When the set threshold is reached, VitalStim Plus will switch to stimulation mode to increase the effort and exercise load. Anatomical Library: VitalStim Plus includes a Dysphagia image library of Anatomy, Pathology and Therapeutic Treatment options to assist in educating your patient.Bluetooth Technology: Screen mirroring technology projects your live treatment onto a computer or tablet screen. This allows you to guide therapeutic exercise activities and increase patient engagement.Patient Data: Treatment data on stimulation and sEMG can be stored, ",plus-dysphagiia-therapy-unit-294.jpg

The increased heat causes increased permeability of cellular membranes, which allows for greater exchange of the cells cytoplasmic contents with its environment. ",qlight-wand-9fb.jpg

SKU:  GF1254 ,Grafco Ishihara Test Chart Books for Color Deficiency ,"The Ishihara color test is a test for color blindness. It was named after its designer, Dr. Shinobu Ishihara (1879-1963), a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917. It makes use of the peculiarity that in red-green blindness, blue and yellow appear remarkably bright compared to red and green.What is colorblindness? Color blindness (color vision deficiency) is a condition in which certain colors cannot be distinguished, and is most commonly due to an inherited condition. Red/Green color blindness is by far the most common (99%) form and causes problems in distinguishing reds and greens. Another color deficiency Blue/Yellow also exists, but is rare (1%) and there is no commonly available test for it. There is no treatment for color blindness, nor is it usually the cause of any significant disability. However, it can be very frustrating for individuals affected by it. Those who are not color blind seem to have the misconception that color blindness means that a color blind person sees only in black and white or shades of gray. While this sort of condition is possible, it is extremely rare. The Ishihara color test is a test for color blindness. It was named after its designer, Dr. Shinobu Ishihara (1879-1963), a professor at the University of Tokyo, who first published his tests in 1917. It makes use of the peculiarity that in red-green blindness, blue and yellow appear remarkably bright compared to red and green. It consists of a number of colored plates, on each plate is printed a circle made of many different sized dots of slightly different colors, spread in a random manner. Within the dot pattern, and differentiated only by color, is a number. What, or even if, a number is visible indicates if and what form of color blindness the viewer has. The full test consists of thirty-eight plates, but the existence of a deficiency is usually clear after fewer plates. The Ishihara Color Charts are accepted by leading authorities worldwide as a simple and accurate test method.  ",ishihara-test-chart-books-for-color-deficiency-4a6.jpg

SKU:  SAMPA8515 ,Jamar Technologies 9 Hole Peg Test Kit ,"Designed by Sammons Preston, the Jamar 9-hole peg test kit is an assessment tool for testing fine motor coordination in recovering patients. The one-piece design features a molded dish, a 9-hole peg board, and a stopwatch. Who Is This Ideal For?The Jamar 9 hole peg test kit is most often used by doctors and physical therapists to test the dexterity of clients and patients who are recovering from surgery or may be exhibiting problems related to motor control, including occupation-related overuse injuries. The test may also help diagnose certain neurocognitive disorders. Why Use the Jamar Test Kit?This 9-hole peg test kit is an all-in-one device that is built using sturdy, durable parts. The placement of the dish and pegboard allows for an easy, consistent reach, which ensures proper results during the evaluation procedure. Thanks to the design and materials, the kit is also easy to clean and maintain, allowing for quick and easy disinfection to prevent any contamination. The test is simple to perform. Using their unaffected hand, the patient places each peg from the dish into a hole. Once all the holes are filled, the patient then removes each peg and places them back in the dish. This helps the patient understand how to properly do the test. Once completed, the healthcare professional records the time, and the patient repeats the test with the affected hand. Who Should Not Use This Product?While this test is similar to the Purdue Pegboard test, which also measures dexterity, the 9-hole peg test is easier to administer, especially to kids. The Purdue test has a longer administration time and was initially designed for selecting employees for certain industrial occupations. This involved more complicated dexterity tasks and greater fine motor precision, making the Purdue Pegboard test unsuitable for children and older patients. The 9-hole peg test’s simplicity, efficiency, and reliability make it a good test that can be administered to patients of all ages and backgrounds.At 4MD, we’re dedicated to providing rehab facilities, nursing homes, clinics, and other healthcare centers with the best, most reliable medical equipment and supplies at a greatly reduced price.

The smooth inner surface allows the foot to glide effortlessly into the sock while the slip resistant coating on the outer surface holds the sock firmly in place. Loop strap can be manipulated with one or two hands and the length is adjusted up to 30"" (76 cm).All plastic, non-porous design eliminates wear and tear associated with cloth sock aids and means it is easy to clean with soap and water, with household disinfectant sprays, and can even be placed in the dishwasher making it ideal for institutions where cross contamination may be a concern.

A bath can relax sore muscles, relieve stress, and can even help improve your circulation. To ensure your safety while you enjoy all the benefits a bath can offer, Drive Medical offers their innovative Whisper Ultra Quiet Bathtub Lift. Assembling the bathtub lift requires no tools and can be installed within minutes allowing you to regain your independence in the bathtub. The two piece bath lift was designed to safely and securely fit standard and deeper bathtubs making storage and travel a breeze. Weighing only 20.5 pounds, the Whisper Ultra Quiet Bathtub Lift is the lightest bath lift on the market and can safely support individuals up to 300 pounds needing assistance getting in and out of the bathtub. The padded seat and backrest was ergonomically designed to minimize physical effort and discomfort while bathing providing the user with the ultimate relaxing experience. The hygienic seat and backrest padding adds additional comfort and can easily be removed from the bathtub lift allowing the covers to be washed. Once the bath lift has been lowered into the bathtub, the backrest can recline up to 50 degrees to allow the user to have more room and stretch out while bathing. To ensure safety four large, durable suction cups stabilize and secure the bath lift to the bath tub. A unique feature of the Whisper Bathtub Lift is the waterproof remote control which can be hung on the backrest when not in use. For added convenience, the hand control floats when in water to ensure you can always locate the controls when needed. Large color coded buttons make it easy for individuals with limited hand dexterity or difficultly with vision. If you are worried about getting a good soak in the bathtub the Whisper Bath lifts slim line profile lowers to 2.3"" and can be raised to 18"" inches when finished bathing.

SKU:  ALIN10317433988317 ,Alliance Labs DocuSol Plus 5ml Mini Enema Docusate Sodium with Benzocaine ,"DocuSol and DocuSol Plus were formulated for the relief of constipation due to infrequent or difficult bowel movements. DocuSol and DocuSol Plus penetrates and softens the stool, thereby promoting bowel movement. The DocuSol and DocuSol Plus formulation functions as a hyper-osmotic laxative by drawing water into the bowel from surrounding body tissues. The docusate sodium acts as a softener by preparing the stool to readily mix with watery fluids. The increased mass of stool promotes a bowel evacuation by stimulating nerve endings in the bowel lining and initiating peristalsis. Not only does it soften and loosen the stool but it initiates a normal stimulus replicating a normal bowel movement. DocuSol and DocuSol Plus helps establish a faster and more predictable bowel movement with reducing bowel accidents and incontinence. DocuSol Plus also contains Benzocaine to anesthetize the rectum and lower bowel; and is beneficial when an anesthetic is needed to prevent hyperreflexia crisis or painful bowel movement.
